/////////////Drunken Master/////////

Drunken Master: A monk who practices the Eight Drunken Immortals style elevates drunkenness to an art form. With a swaying body and stumbling steps, they may appear even foolishly comical; but behind every stagger and lurch lies solid fundamentals and a meticulously choreographed dance of blocks, parries, advances, retreats, attacks, and defenses. Such a monk does not merely treat fine wine as a vice, but as a weapon, a shield, and a medium to channel inner power.
'Wine is good, but too much harms the body. Three parts drunk is best.'

Features:

- Playful Wanderer of the Mortal Realm: The Drunken Master has no connection to the traditional monastic disciplines and monastery life of ordinary monks. They often wander the rivers and lakes, the markets and alleys, preferring to act on whims and impulses. Thus, they tend to be of Neutral or even Chaotic alignment.
(When selecting the wine flask, alignment may shift to Neutral or Chaotic.)
- Ever-Present Wine Flask: A Drunken Master always carries a wine flask, filled with his favorite brew. He is intimately familiar with this wine and can precisely control each sip to achieve a precise level of intoxication.
(Initially, must choose the flask's placement. May reselect its placement upon reaching legendary status.)
(After the first sip, can use either 'Lü Dongbin, Drunken Lift That Crushes with Divine' or 'Li Tieguai, Spinning Heel That Drinks the Sky' attack modes.)
(After the second sip, can use either 'Zhongli Quan, Drunken Ram That Breaks the Iron Fan' or 'Zhang Guolao, Cup-Tossed Kicks That Flow' attack modes.)
(After the third sip, can use either 'Han Xiangzi, Flute-Hand Strike That Makes the Foe Dizzy' or 'Lan Caihe, Single Toast That Makes the Waist-Breaking Strike' attack modes.)
(Attack modes remain active in combat until no enemies are in sight for four consecutive rounds.)
(After the fifth sip, reaching 'five parts drunk,' the character truly becomes intoxicated, displaying a drunk icon and suffering penalties. Further drinking worsens effects. Ten sips is the limit; drinking more yields no additional changes.)
(Drunkenness lasts until rest or travel. Buying wine at a tavern is equally effective, but the intoxication gained per drink is influenced by Constitution.)
(Digesting alcohol takes time; most abilities fueled by wine typically activate on the round *after* drinking.)
- Fortune in the Cups: Even in a tipsy state, the Drunken Master often stumbles into good luck, though this fortune rarely catches up with the troubles brought by overindulgence. This ability grants the Drunken Master a starting +1 Luck bonus, but it is insufficient to offset the penalties of heavy intoxication.
- Surging Wine Power: After drinking, the Drunken Master's strength surges, while his perception dulls and his speech and actions become harder to control. After the first sip: Strength +1, Intelligence -1. After the second sip: Dexterity +1, Wisdom -1. After the third sip: Constitution +1 (or if Constitution is already 16, increases maximum HP by 10%), Charisma -1. These attribute changes last until sober. After reaching 12th level, all attribute changes increase to 2 points (maximum HP increase up to 20%).
- Stumbling Drunken Steps: The Drunken Master's steps are crooked and unsteady, yet conceal a pattern elusive to grasp, making it difficult for blades and even magic to touch his robes. After drinking, the Drunken Master gains a +2 AC bonus against all weapon types and immunity to some movement-impairing effects, including Haste, Slow, and Hold. He also gains an additional success chance against effects like Grease, Entangle, and Web.
- Liquid Courage: Fortified by wine, the Drunken Master's bravery swells, allowing him to resist most external mental attacks, including Fear, Charm, Rage, and Confusion.
- Soothing Channels: The Drunken Master can spend a full round channeling the wine's power within to mend wounds, reducing his drunkenness by one level. At 1st level, this is equivalent to Cure Light Wounds. At 4th level, it improves to Cure Moderate Wounds and neutralize poison. At 8th level, it improves to Cure Serious Wounds and neutralize poison/disease. At 12th level, it improves to Cure Critical Wounds and neutralize poison/disease/deafness/silence/blindness. While using this technique, The Drunken Master temporarily suppresses the effects of any poison to prevent it from spreading through his body with the wine's flow.
- Fiery Breath: The Drunken Master quickly holds a mouthful of strong liquor, ignites it, and exhales, dealing 1d6 fire damage per 2 levels (max 10d6) in an 8-ft radius cone. This technique consumes only a small amount of vigor and can be used five times per day.
- Unleashed Wine Power (High-Level Skill): The Drunken Master's control over wine reaches a new realm. Each sip now unlocks greater potential but distances reason further, increasing the attribute changes from drinking to 3 points.
- Eight Immortals Feast (High-Level Skill): The Drunken Master masters the most difficult and powerful technique of the Eight Drunken Immortals style. After the fourth sip, he can freely use either 'Cao Guojiu, Immortal’s Toast That Seals the Throat' or 'He Xiangu, Swaying Waist That Dances Through the Blue' attack modes.
- Accustomed Drunken Body (High-Level Skill): Years of drinking allow The Drunken Master's body to gradually adapt to functioning while heavily intoxicated. After becoming truly drunk (five parts), each additional level of drunkenness grants +1 Luck (max +5), though still insufficient to offset the penalties of deep intoxication.
- Liquor's Numbness (High-Level Skill): At a certain level of drunkenness, The Drunken Master's body becomes numb to pain. After the fourth sip, he gains 50% resistance to all damage for 2 rounds. Continued drinking can maintain this effect, but one must mind the penalties of drunkenness. This effect cannot be triggered at ten parts drunk.
- Blunder into Technique (High-Level Skill): If the Drunken Master critically fails an attack, he does so in a classic display of physical comedy. The target must save vs. Spell (DC increases by 1 per 10 Drunken Master levels) or fall down laughing for 1d3 rounds. This has no effect on non-living targets, and alien creatures receive a +4 bonus to their save due to difficulty understanding the humor.
- Clarity in the Cup (High-Level Skill): The Drunken Master achieves a balance between drunkenness and sobriety, making him even more fearsome. He can now benefit from all positive effects of 'Liquid Courage' and 'Stumbling Drunken Steps' without needing to drink.
- Whale's Draught (High-Level Skill): The Drunken Master throws his head back and guzzles, consuming a large amount of wine in a short time. He can spend a full round to gain the effects of four sips at once, but moving or being attacked during the process interrupts the ability.
- Drunken Frenzy (Requires Drunkenness): In the depths of intoxication, The Drunken Master lets instinct drive his body, becoming a chaotic whirlwind. This skill doubles his attacks per round, and any once-per-round special effects from his attack modes also occur twice per round. This skill requires a drunkenness bonus; it has no effect when sober. After becoming truly drunk (five parts), each level of drunkenness adds 1 round to its duration (max 6 rounds).
- Drunken Chaos (Requires Drunkenness): The Drunken Master excels at charging into the heart of battle and using unexpected attacks to create confusion. Upon activation, all enemies within 8 feet must save vs. Breath or be randomly afflicted with one or more conditions (Confusion, Poison, Deafness, Slow, etc.) for 2 rounds. This skill requires a drunkenness bonus; it has no effect when sober. After becoming truly drunk (five parts), each level of drunkenness adds +2 to the save DC (max +10).

Disadvantages:

- Loses the standard monk's Magic Resistance.
- Loses the standard monk's Movement Speed bonus and Free Action effect.
- Loses the standard monk's immunity to Poison, Disease, Charm, and non-magical weapons.
- Cannot use 'Stunning Fist,' 'Quivering Palm,' or the standard monk's high-level skills.

Detailed Attack Mode Descriptions:

Lü Dongbin, Drunken Lift That Crushes with Divine
- Leads with a sword-finger thrust, then smashes with elbow and backhand fist, like a drunken sword-immortal lifting a wine pot to strike.
- In this mode, the Drunken Master's melee damage increases by 1 point +1 point per 4 levels.

Li Tieguai, Spinning Heel That Drinks the Sky
- Sinks and spins, chaining knee strikes and sweeping leg attacks, like a cripple attacking the lower body with an iron crutch.
- In this mode, enemies hit by The Drunken Master suffer a -2 AC penalty for 2 seconds (non-stacking). If they fail a save vs. Breath, they are tripped and suffer an additional -4 AC penalty for 2 seconds.
- A 1st-level Drunken Master allows enemies a +6 bonus to the save. The save DC increases by 1 per 4 character levels. Enemies without feet or of Large size or larger cannot be tripped.

Zhongli Quan, Drunken Ram That Breaks the Iron Fan
- Stumbles forward, striking with head or shoulder, using just the right amount of force to maintain balance, like embracing a wine jar with both hands and exerting force without breaking it.
- In this mode, once per round, one of The Drunken Master's attacks has a bull rush effect, dealing an additional 1d4/2 levels (max 10d4) crushing damage and knocking the enemy back. If the enemy fails a save vs. Death, they are knocked prone and unconscious for 1 round.
- A 1st-level Drunken Master allows enemies a +6 bonus to the save. The save DC increases by 1 per 4 character levels.

Zhang Guolao, Cup-Tossed Kicks That Flow
- Uses hands to support the body while spinning to launch a chain of kicks, like a drunkard rolling on the ground.
- In this mode, a successful melee hit by The Drunken Master grants him +1 attack the following round (does not stack).

Han Xiangzi, Flute-Hand Strike That Makes the Foe Dizzy
- Seizes the opponent's wrist and strikes their chest/abdomen. Quickly holds wine in the mouth and, as the target instinctively gasps from the blow, sprays it onto their face, forcing them to choke and inhale the liquor.
- In this mode, once per round, The Drunken Master attempts a Grapple (ignoring AC and spell protections) against the nearest enemy, blinding them for 2 rounds (can be avoided with a save vs. Breath at -2 penalty) and increasing their intoxication by three levels. An enemy sprayed twice becomes drunk and suffers a -4 penalty to rolls; a third spray inflicts a -10 penalty.
- Non-living enemies are unaffected by the spray.

Lan Caihe, Single Toast That Makes the Waist-Breaking Strike
- Dives beneath or behind the enemy to launch a surprise attack, then seizes the opportunity to lift them by the waist and slam them down, like lifting a flower basket.
- In this mode, once per round, The Drunken Master attempts a Grapple (ignoring AC and spell protections) against the nearest enemy and slams them prone, dealing 1d6/2 levels (max 10d6) bludgeoning damage. If the enemy fails a save vs. Death, they are unconscious for 2 rounds.
- A 1st-level ArDrunken Masterhat allows enemies a +6 bonus to the save. The save DC increases by 1 per 4 character levels. Enemies of Large size or larger cannot be slammed prone.

Cao Guojiu, Immortal’s Toast That Seals the Throat
- Fingers hook like holding a wine cup, strikes out as if offering a toast to lock the enemy's throat. A sudden exertion of force can be fatal.
- In this mode, once per round, one of The Drunken Master's attacks has a Death effect. If the enemy fails a save vs. Breath, they die instantly.
- A 1st-level Drunken Master allows enemies a +6 bonus to the save. The save DC increases by 1 per 4 character levels. Non-living enemies are unaffected.

He Xiangu, Swaying Waist That Dances Through the Blue
- Controls distance with drunken steps, twists the waist to evade enemy attacks while storing force for a rebound, suddenly counterattacking upon spinning back.
- In this mode, the Drunken Master gains a +4 bonus to hit and has a 50% chance to avoid all physical attacks and damaging/disablement spells.

Note:
Due to engine limitations, even if sufficiently drunk from tavern wine, 'Liquor's Numbness' must be activated via the personal wine flask. However, this skill does not require waiting a round; it takes effect immediately upon drinking.

/////////////Improved Monks/////////

COMPONENT 1
  Improve monk with Balthazar' abilities. There're 3 modes to be chosen: Only improves the base class monk with no kit/ Improves all monk kits, including installed monk kit MODs/ Work as a new kit, the Honed Monk.

COMPONENT 2
  Armed monk. Allows monks to use two-handed light weapons (staves and spears) and can invest more slots to Weapon Proficiences and Weapon Styles. But with disadvantage that the attack animations are not in tune (I don't know how to fix animations).
  It is highly recommended to install my MOD 'Weapon Style Rebalance Rebalance' as a cooperation, which allows monks to use tripping skill while holding a single weapon, and to cast more powerful tripping with bare hands.

COMPONENT 3
  Allows all bare-handed skills (e.g. Stunning Blow and Quivering Palm) of monks to be effective also on melee weapons. Supports monk kit MODs installed already.

/////////////Improved Wizard Slayer/////////

  This patch provides some new abilities to the Wizard Slayer. You can also choose whether to allow Wizard Slayers to use more types of equipment.

  Magic Endurance. As specialist to counter spellcasters, a Wizard Slayer undergo rigorous training against magical threats. This grants him a permanent +3 bonus to Saving Throws vs. Spell.

  Magic Shatter. For every five levels gained, a Wizard Slayers can use his Magic Shatter ability one additional time per day. This ability removes one combat protection and one special protection from a target opponent.

  Slayer's Deterrence. A hostile caster approached within 4 feet by a Wizard Slayer needs to save against death each round or suffer a penalty of reduced casting speed (1 point +1 point / 6 Wizard Slayer levels) and reduced casting level (1 level / 2 Wizard Slayer levels) in 2 rounds. The caster hit by the Wizard Slayer's attack must also make this saving throw, but effects do not stack. Every 4 levels of Wizard Slayer increase the difficulty of check by 1 (save with +4 bonus at level 1, -6 penalty at level 40).

  Far-named Slayer (HLA). Name of an epic Wizard Slayer shockes every caster in the land of Faerun. The effective range of Slayer's Deterrence, which decreases hostile casters' casting speed and casting level, grows up to 15 feet.

  Absolute Protection (HLA). An epic Wizard Slayer can stimulate their potential to temporarily protect their beneficial state from being driven away by magic. This ability allows Wizard Slayer to be protected from all abjuration and magic attack spell for one round, including Dispel Magic, Breach, Lower Resistance, etc. 

  Dead Magic Domain. (HLA). An epic Wizard Slayer can collect aether that interfere with spells in one day and release them in one moment. This ability turns the area within the sight of Wizard Slayer into a dead magic area and lasts for 1 turn. No one can cast spells during this period, while innate abilities are not affected. 

/////////////Shaman Hauler/////////

COMPONENT 1
  A shaman get an ability to 'Grant Carrying Permission' to be casted for only once at level 1, allowing a teammate to carry the shaman himself to the destination without interrupting his dance.
The teammate has permanently acquired a new ability of 'Carry the Shaman'. Cast this ability (requires a strength of at least 16) while standing at a dancing shaman's side and then the shaman'll move with you. This ability can be casted for once in each round.

  A shaman also get a high-level ability 'Grant Transfer Permission' to be cast for only once, allowing a teammate to act as a agent to teleport onto the destination together with the shaman himself without interrupting his dance.

NOTIFICATIONS
  This MOD should be intalled after MODs of new campaigns ( if there're any ).
  The shaman must have started dancing before the carrying work begins. The work begins with pressing of the ability button and lasts for 1 round.  Summoned creatures follow the dancing shaman during the process.
  If the teammate is not close enough to the shaman and the shaman does not reach level 15, the moving will not begin. It begins as soon as the teammate gets close to the shaman manually. 
  The teammate cannot hide, sing, turn undead or detect trap, but he can stop moving at any time to attack or cast. The shaman will drop off after 1 round.
  When the shaman reaches level 15, the teammate does not need to approach the shaman. He will be automatically summoned to the shaman's side and then starts his work.
  If there is more than one shaman in the team and are all dancing near the hauler, he'll carry the one who joins the team first.
  Magic images, such as project image and simulacrum of the shamans, can not be carried.

/////////////Improved Beastmaster/////////

SUMMON TRAINED ANIMALS：This ability allows the beastmaster to summon animals possessing the classes of Warrior, Archer, Stalker, Cleric, or Bard. As the beastmaster levels up, the types of summoned animals may change, and the magical enhancement bonus of the animal’s natural weapons increases by +1 every 3 levels, up to a maximum of +5 at level 15. These animals can accompany the beastmaster across maps and remain active in combat until the party rests. Only one animal of each class may be summoned simultaneously. The beastmaster gains this ability once every 2 levels, with a maximum of 10 total instances.
PACK COMMAND：Grants all allied animals within line of sight Temporary HP (10 + 10 HP per 3 Beastmaster levels), Combat Bonuses (+1 to hit/damage/AC per 3 Beastmaster levels, +1 to saves per 6 Beastmaster levels), Regeneration (1 + 1 HP/round per 6 Beastmaster levels) and Attack Per Round (1/2 + 1/2 APR per 9 Beastmaster levels). It also grants them immunity against Fear & Morale Broken (at LV1), Charm & Control (at LV6), Confusion (at LV12), and some of the Death Effects (e.g. Power Word Kill, Deathblow, at LV15). All enhancements rapidly fade when animals leave the Beastmaster's visual range.
