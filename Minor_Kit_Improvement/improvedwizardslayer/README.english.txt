***** Introduction *****

	This patch provides a new passive ability to the Wizard Slayer, as well as several high-level abilities. You can also choose whether to allow Wizard Slayers to use more types of equipment.

	Slayer's Deterrence. A hostile caster approached within 4 feet by a Wizard Slayer needs to save against death each round or suffer a penalty of reduced casting speed (1 point +1 point / 6 Wizard Slayer levels) and reduced casting level (1 level / 2 Wizard Slayer levels) in this round. Every 4 levels of Wizard Slayer increase the difficulty of check by 1 (allows saving with +4 bonus at level 1, -6 penalty at level 40). 

	Far-named Slayer (HLA). Name of an epic Wizard Slayer shockes every caster in the land of Faerun. The effective range of Slayer's Deterrence, which decreases hostile casters' casting speed and casting level, grows up to 15 feet.

	Absolute Protection (HLA). An epic Wizard Slayer can stimulate their potential to temporarily protect their beneficial state from being driven away by magic. This ability allows Wizard Slayer to be protected from all abjuration and magic attack spell for one round, including Dispel Magic, Breach, Lower Resistance, etc. 

	Dead Magic Domain. (HLA). An epic Wizard Slayer can collect aether that interfere with spells in one day and release them in one moment. This ability turns the area within the sight of Wizard Slayer into a dead magic area and lasts for 1 turn. No one can cast spells during this period, while innate abilities are not affected. 

***** Compatibility *****

	Only BG EE series are supported.
	Compatible with any other MODs that modifies the original Wizard Slayer kits. Requied to be installed after such MODs, then all modifications of them as well as HLA revisions are remained.
