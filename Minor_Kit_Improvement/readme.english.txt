/////////////Minor_Kit_Improvement v0.2////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Currently includes Improvements for: Monk, Wizard Slayer, Shaman, Beastmaster, and Dragon Disciple Sorcerer.

/////////////Improved Monks/////////

COMPONENT 1
  Improve monk with Balthazar' abilities. There're 3 modes to be chosen: Only improves the base class monk with no kit/ Improves all monk kits, including installed monk kit MODs/ Work as a new kit, the Honed Monk.

COMPONENT 2
  Armed monk. Allows monks to use two-handed light weapons (staves and spears) and can invest one more slot to Weapon Proficiences and Weapon Styles (two more slots for Two-Weapons Style). But with disadvantage that the attack animations are not in tune (I don't know how to fix animations).
  It is highly recommended to install my MOD "Weapon Style Rebalance Rebalance" as a cooperation, which allows monks to use tripping skill while holding a single weapon, and to cast more powerful tripping with bare hands.

COMPONENT 3
  Allows all bare-handed skills (e.g. Stunning Blow and Quivering Palm) of monks to be effective also on melee weapons. Supports monk kit MODs installed already.

/////////////Improved Wizard Slayer/////////

  This patch provides a new passive ability to the Wizard Slayer, as well as several high-level abilities. You can also choose whether to allow Wizard Slayers to use more types of equipment.

  Slayer's Deterrence. A hostile caster approached within 4 feet by a Wizard Slayer needs to save against death each round or suffer a penalty of reduced casting speed (1 point +1 point / 6 Wizard Slayer levels) and reduced casting level (1 level / 2 Wizard Slayer levels) in this round. Every 4 levels of Wizard Slayer increase the difficulty of check by 1 (allows saving with +4 bonus at level 1, -6 penalty at level 40). 

  Far-named Slayer (HLA). Name of an epic Wizard Slayer shockes every caster in the land of Faerun. The effective range of Slayer's Deterrence, which decreases hostile casters' casting speed and casting level, grows up to 15 feet.

  Absolute Protection (HLA). An epic Wizard Slayer can stimulate their potential to temporarily protect their beneficial state from being driven away by magic. This ability allows Wizard Slayer to be protected from all abjuration and magic attack spell for one round, including Dispel Magic, Breach, Lower Resistance, etc. 

  Dead Magic Domain. (HLA). An epic Wizard Slayer can collect aether that interfere with spells in one day and release them in one moment. This ability turns the area within the sight of Wizard Slayer into a dead magic area and lasts for 1 turn. No one can cast spells during this period, while innate abilities are not affected. 

/////////////Shaman Hauler/////////

COMPONENT 1
  A shaman get an ability to "Grant Carrying Permission" to be casted for only once at level 1, allowing a teammate to carry the shaman himself to the destination without interrupting his dance.
The teammate has permanently acquired a new ability of "Carry the Shaman". Cast this ability (requires a strength of at least 16) while standing at a dancing shaman's side and then the shaman'll move with you. This ability can be casted for once in each round.

  A shaman also get a high-level ability "Grant Transfer Permission" to be cast for only once, allowing a teammate to act as a agent to teleport onto the destination together with the shaman himself without interrupting his dance.
  The teammate has permanently acquired a new ability to "Transport the Shaman". There are no restrictions on distance and strength for applying this ability. Click on the destination to perform the teleportion. This ability can be casted for once in each round.

COMPONENT 2
  Enables manual control of Shaman-summoned spirits.

NOTIFICATIONS
  This MOD should be intalled after MODs of new campaigns ( if there're any ).
  The shaman must have started dancing before the carrying work begins. The work begins with pressing of the ability button and lasts for 1 round.  Summoned creatures follow the dancing shaman during the process.
  If the teammate is not close enough to the shaman and the shaman does not reach level 15, the moving will not begin. It begins as soon as the teammate gets close to the shaman manually. 
  The teammate cannot hide, sing, turn undead or detect trap, but he can stop moving at any time to attack or cast. The shaman will drop off after 1 round.
  When the shaman reaches level 15, the teammate does not need to approach the shaman. He will be automatically summoned to the shaman's side and then starts his work.
  If there is more than one shaman in the team and are all dancing near the hauler, he'll carry the one who joins the team first.
  Magic images, such as project image and simulacrum of the shamans, can not be carried.

/////////////Improved Beastmaster/////////

Only one new ability for Beastmaster:
PACK COMMAND：Grants all allied animals within line of sight Temporary HP (10 + 10 HP per 5 Beastmaster levels), Combat Bonuses (+1 to hit/damage/saves/AC per 5 Beastmaster levels), Regeneration (1 + 1 HP/round per 5 Beastmaster levels) and Attack Per Round (1/2 + 1/2 APR per 10 Beastmaster levels). It also grants them immunity against Fear & Morale Broken (at LV1), Charm & Control (at LV5), Confusion (at LV10), and some of the Death Effects (e.g. Power Word Kill, Deathblow, at LV15). All enhancements rapidly fade when animals leave the Beastmaster's visual range.

/////////////Dragon Disciple Reincarnation/////////////

COMPONENT 1
Allow Dragon Disciple to transforms into specified class and kit, disables original spellcasting, retains passive draconic traits: AC bonuses, Constitution, fire resistance, etc.

COMPONENT 2
Overhauls Dragon Disciple's passive progression rewards to align with 3rd Edition rules
