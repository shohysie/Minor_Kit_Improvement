@611 = ~Drunken Master~
@612 = ~Drunken Master: A monk who practices the Eight Drunken Immortals style elevates drunkenness to an art form. With a swaying body and stumbling steps, they may appear even foolishly comical; but behind every stagger and lurch lies solid fundamentals and a meticulously choreographed dance of blocks, parries, advances, retreats, attacks, and defenses. Such a monk does not merely treat fine wine as a vice, but as a weapon, a shield, and a medium to channel inner power.
'Wine is good, but too much harms the body. Three parts drunk is best.'

Features:

- Playful Wanderer of the Mortal Realm: The Drunken Master has no connection to the traditional monastic disciplines and monastery life of ordinary monks. They often wander the rivers and lakes, the markets and alleys, preferring to act on whims and impulses. Thus, they tend to be of Neutral or even Chaotic alignment.
(When selecting the wine flask, alignment may shift to Neutral or Chaotic.)
- Ever-Present Wine Flask: A Drunken Master always carries a wine flask, filled with his favorite brew. He is intimately familiar with this wine and can precisely control each sip to achieve a precise level of intoxication.
(Initially, must choose the flask's placement. May reselect its placement upon reaching legendary status.)
(After the first sip, can use either 'Lü Dongbin, Drunken Lift That Crushes with Divine' or 'Li Tieguai, Spinning Heel That Drinks the Sky' attack modes.)
(After the second sip, can use either 'Zhongli Quan, Drunken Ram That Breaks the Iron Fan' or 'Zhang Guolao, Cup-Tossed Kicks That Flow' attack modes.)
(After the third sip, can use either 'Han Xiangzi, Flute-Hand Strike That Makes the Foe Dizzy' or 'Lan Caihe, Single Toast That Makes the Waist-Breaking Strike' attack modes.)
(Attack modes remain active in combat until no enemies are in sight for four consecutive rounds.)
(After the fifth sip, reaching 'five parts drunk,' the character truly becomes intoxicated, displaying a drunk icon and suffering penalties. Further drinking worsens effects. Ten sips is the limit; drinking more yields no additional changes.)
(Drunkenness lasts until rest or travel. Buying wine at a tavern is equally effective, but the intoxication gained per drink is influenced by Constitution.)
(Digesting alcohol takes time; most abilities fueled by wine typically activate on the round *after* drinking.)
- Fortune in the Cups: Even in a tipsy state, the Drunken Master often stumbles into good luck, though this fortune rarely catches up with the troubles brought by overindulgence. This ability grants the Drunken Master a starting +1 Luck bonus, but it is insufficient to offset the penalties of heavy intoxication.
- Surging Wine Power: After drinking, the Drunken Master's strength surges, while his perception dulls and his speech and actions become harder to control. After the first sip: Strength +1, Intelligence -1. After the second sip: Dexterity +1, Wisdom -1. After the third sip: Constitution +1 (or if Constitution is already 16, increases maximum HP by 10%), Charisma -1. These attribute changes last until sober. After reaching 12th level, all attribute changes increase to 2 points (maximum HP increase up to 20%).
- Stumbling Drunken Steps: The Drunken Master's steps are crooked and unsteady, yet conceal a pattern elusive to grasp, making it difficult for blades and even magic to touch his robes. After drinking, the Drunken Master gains a +2 AC bonus against all weapon types and immunity to some movement-impairing effects, including Haste, Slow, and Hold. He also gains an additional success chance against effects like Grease, Entangle, and Web.
- Liquid Courage: Fortified by wine, the Drunken Master's bravery swells, allowing him to resist most external mental attacks, including Fear, Charm, Rage, and Confusion.
- Soothing Channels: The Drunken Master can spend a full round channeling the wine's power within to mend wounds, reducing his drunkenness by one level. At 1st level, this is equivalent to Cure Light Wounds. At 4th level, it improves to Cure Moderate Wounds and neutralize poison. At 8th level, it improves to Cure Serious Wounds and neutralize poison/disease. At 12th level, it improves to Cure Critical Wounds and neutralize poison/disease/deafness/silence/blindness. While using this technique, The Drunken Master temporarily suppresses the effects of any poison to prevent it from spreading through his body with the wine's flow.
- Fiery Breath: The Drunken Master quickly holds a mouthful of strong liquor, ignites it, and exhales, dealing 1d6 fire damage per 2 levels (max 10d6) in an 8-ft radius cone. This technique consumes only a small amount of vigor and can be used five times per day.
- Unleashed Wine Power (High-Level Skill): The Drunken Master's control over wine reaches a new realm. Each sip now unlocks greater potential but distances reason further, increasing the attribute changes from drinking to 3 points.
- Eight Immortals Feast (High-Level Skill): The Drunken Master masters the most difficult and powerful technique of the Eight Drunken Immortals style. After the fourth sip, he can freely use either 'Cao Guojiu, Immortal’s Toast That Seals the Throat' or 'He Xiangu, Swaying Waist That Dances Through the Blue' attack modes.
- Accustomed Drunken Body (High-Level Skill): Years of drinking allow The Drunken Master's body to gradually adapt to functioning while heavily intoxicated. After becoming truly drunk (five parts), each additional level of drunkenness grants +1 Luck (max +5), though still insufficient to offset the penalties of deep intoxication.
- Liquor's Numbness (High-Level Skill): At a certain level of drunkenness, The Drunken Master's body becomes numb to pain. After the fourth sip, he gains 50% resistance to all damage for 2 rounds. Continued drinking can maintain this effect, but one must mind the penalties of drunkenness. This effect cannot be triggered at ten parts drunk.
- Blunder into Technique (High-Level Skill): If the Drunken Master critically fails an attack, he does so in a classic display of physical comedy. The target must save vs. Spell (DC increases by 1 per 10 Drunken Master levels) or fall down laughing for 1d3 rounds. This has no effect on non-living targets, and alien creatures receive a +4 bonus to their save due to difficulty understanding the humor.
- Clarity in the Cup (High-Level Skill): The Drunken Master achieves a balance between drunkenness and sobriety, making him even more fearsome. He can now benefit from all positive effects of 'Liquid Courage' and 'Stumbling Drunken Steps' without needing to drink.
- Whale's Draught (High-Level Skill): The Drunken Master throws his head back and guzzles, consuming a large amount of wine in a short time. He can spend a full round to gain the effects of four sips at once, but moving or being attacked during the process interrupts the ability.
- Drunken Frenzy (Requires Drunkenness): In the depths of intoxication, The Drunken Master lets instinct drive his body, becoming a chaotic whirlwind. This skill doubles his attacks per round, and any once-per-round special effects from his attack modes also occur twice per round. This skill requires a drunkenness bonus; it has no effect when sober. After becoming truly drunk (five parts), each level of drunkenness adds 1 round to its duration (max 6 rounds).
- Drunken Chaos (Requires Drunkenness): The Drunken Master excels at charging into the heart of battle and using unexpected attacks to create confusion. Upon activation, all enemies within 8 feet must save vs. Breath or be randomly afflicted with one or more conditions (Confusion, Poison, Deafness, Slow, etc.) for 2 rounds. This skill requires a drunkenness bonus; it has no effect when sober. After becoming truly drunk (five parts), each level of drunkenness adds +2 to the save DC (max +10).

Disadvantages:

- Loses the standard monk's Magic Resistance.
- Loses the standard monk's Movement Speed bonus and Free Action effect.
- Loses the standard monk's immunity to Poison, Disease, Charm, and non-magical weapons.
- Cannot use 'Stunning Fist,' 'Quivering Palm,' or the standard monk's high-level skills.

Note:
Due to engine limitations, even if sufficiently drunk from tavern wine, 'Liquor's Numbness' must be activated via the personal wine flask. However, this skill does not require waiting a round; it takes effect immediately upon drinking.~
