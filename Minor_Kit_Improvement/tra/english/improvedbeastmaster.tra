SUMMON TRAINED ANIMALS：This ability allows the beastmaster to summon animals possessing the classes of Warrior, Archer, Stalker, Cleric, or Bard. As the beastmaster levels up, the types of summoned animals may change, and the magical enhancement bonus of the animal’s natural weapons increases by +1 every 3 levels, up to a maximum of +5 at level 15. These animals can accompany the beastmaster across maps and remain active in combat until the party rests. Only one animal of each class may be summoned simultaneously. The beastmaster gains this ability once every 2 levels, with a maximum of 10 total instances.
PACK COMMAND：Grants all allied animals within line of sight Temporary HP (10 + 10 HP per 3 Beastmaster levels), Combat Bonuses (+1 to hit/damage/AC per 3 Beastmaster levels, +1 to saves per 6 Beastmaster levels), Regeneration (1 + 1 HP/round per 6 Beastmaster levels) and Attack Per Round (1/2 + 1/2 APR per 9 Beastmaster levels). It also grants them immunity against Fear & Morale Broken (at LV1), Charm & Control (at LV6), Confusion (at LV12), and some of the Death Effects (e.g. Power Word Kill, Deathblow, at LV15). All enhancements rapidly fade when animals leave the Beastmaster's visual range."
